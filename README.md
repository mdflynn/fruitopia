## Challenges
#### CORS
Right away I ran into a CORS issue when trying to bring in fetch data to the app. I tried a few routes using different headers but was unable to successfully get around the error initially. I ended up referencing this [article](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43871637/no-access-control-allow-origin-header-is-present-on-the-requested-resource-whe) which led me to creating a CORS proxy server to make the requests through. This worked great and allowed me to continue building the app.
